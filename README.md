***Prototype Name :- AgriTech Solution for Commodity Market Price Forecasting***

### **Problem Statement -** 
Develop a solution that helps farmers adapt to climate change :-   Climate change threatens agriculture, particularly for farmers facing extreme weather and changing growing conditions. Develop solutions such as software that can suggest drought-resistant crops, a system that manages extreme weather conditions or advanced irrigation systems to help farmers adapt. By promoting climate-smart technologies, the goal is to enhance agricultural resilience, ensure food security, and support sustainable farming practices for long-term economic stability

### **Solution -**
We will be building a multi-target based Market Price Forecasting tool for the particular Commodity for specific State’s District, integrating historical price data with climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity. This solution helps farmers adapt to climate change by predicting future prices and recommending the best times to sell crops based on weather conditions

### **Approach:**
 **1.Data Collection:** *We will be gathering  historical market prices and climate data relevant to Kerala’s agricultural conditions.*
 
 **2.Forecasting Model:** *Using time series models like Fb-Prophet and machine learning algorithms (e.g.,XGBoost), we forecast future prices..*
 
 **3.Climate-Resilient Insights:** *The model captures the impact of extreme weather on prices, providing farmers with actionable insights to mitigate climate risks.*
 
 **4.Deployment:** *Our tool is accessible via a web platform, offering real-time forecasts and recommendations, empowering farmers to make informed decisions*

 ### **Motivation -**

  *  Climate change threatens agriculture, especially for small-scale farmers, by causing unpredictable weather like droughts and floods that disrupt crop yields and market prices. This leads to economic instability and food insecurity. Our tool integrates market price forecasts with climate data, helping farmers make informed decisions, boost productivity, and protect their livelihoods against climate risks.

    
 *  Solving this issue matters to me because agriculture forms the backbone of rural economies, and climate change is already affecting millions of farmers worldwide. Providing farmers with tools to adapt to these challenges can help ensure food security, enhance their economic stability, and promote sustainable farming practices. This not only supports individual farmers but contributes to the overall well-being of society by ensuring a steady food supply and reducing poverty in agricultural communities
